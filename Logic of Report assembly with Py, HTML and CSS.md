Interdependence and role of each file/script:
- **`generate_report.py`**
	- **Ingestion:** It reads the "raw materials"—the CSV tables and PNG plots generated by your upstream R scripts.
	- **Styling Logic:** acts as a translator between raw numbers and visual cues. For example, it scans a table cell for "80%", determines that this meets a target, and attaches a label (like `"bg-green"`) to that specific piece of data. Practically, it adds a dictionary `{"text": value, "color_class": "bg-red"}` which the HTML reads. This is done via **helper functions**, so that a specific processing logic can be applied to multiple csv tables.
	* **Rendering**: It combines the data with the HTML template using **Jinja2**, creating a complete, filled-out HTML file.
	    
- **`report_template.html`** : defines the **structure** of the report. It contains no actual data, only placeholders.
	- **Placeholders:** Instead of writing "October 2025," it has a placeholder like `{{ period_human }}` which Python replaces with the real date.
	- **Loops:** Instead of hard-coding a table with 10 rows, it defines a single loop (`{% for row in table %}`). This allows the report to **expand dynamically** whether the input CSV has 5 rows or 50. 
	- **Skeleton:** It organizes the page into logical sections—headers, plot containers, and footers—essentially defining the "grid" that holds the content.

- **`report_style.css`** : applies **styling**, which dictates the visual rules for the final PDF. In this context, "styling" covers three distinct layers:
	- **Logic-Driven Visuals:** It maps the logic tags created by Python to actual colors. When Python tags a cell as `"bg-red"`, the CSS ensures it is rendered with the specific hex code `#E03531` (red).
	- **Print/PDF Formatting:** Unlike a standard webpage, this CSS defines physical properties essential for a report, such as forcing the page size to **A4 Landscape**, setting specific margins (1cm), and handling page numbering automatically.
	- **Layout Control:** It manages complex positioning, such as ensuring the "Cover Page" has a blue sidebar that takes up exactly 20% of the width, or ensuring the header appears at the top of every new page.
