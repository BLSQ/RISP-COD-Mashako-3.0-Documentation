This should be everything you need to answer all your questions like *where is that from?* or *what is that?* or *how did you do this?* … 

* **OpenHEXA workspace**: - [COD Mashako 3.0 BLSQ](https://app.openhexa.org/workspaces/cod-mashako-3-0/)
* [DHIS2 EZD SNIS web interface](https://ezd.snisrdc.com/dhis/dhis-web-login/): useful to navigate and manually check stuff ![[Pasted image 20251224152142.png]]
* **Reports to be replicated (what we are trying to make)**: Acasus is still in charge of (co-)design (with the PEV) and developing the reports for Mashako 3.0. So we basically have to re-create what they made, but using different tools. Therefore, we should look at the current Tableau dashboard. The dashboard itself is exported as print screen-ed PDF, so the Acasus “dashboard” and the Acasus “report” are **effectively the same** thing. How can you see them?
	* [**Tableau dashboard**](https://eu-west-1a.online.tableau.com/#/site/axdata/views/DashboardCatalog-Mashako/DashboardCatalog?:iid=1) ← you can only see if they granted access to your BLSQ Gmail account! These are *not* credentials that can be just shared with 1password! 
	* (<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ADD link to GDrive folder with examples of reports - MAKE IT</mark>) **Exported Reports (PDFs)**: these we exported by me (Giulia) and saved in GDrive for easy access. Note that the dashboard is still a WIP, so the content of the reports might have changed since my last export! 
* **Formulas for the calculation of Indicators**: [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XW3JFWwOEP2GzAKgLOjCCQOt0vGXPgzbKxxiIOY8K8w/edit?usp=sharing) developed with Thomas Warichet. This allows to identify the correct DHIS2 dataElements (de) for the calculations. 
* **Mapping of DHIS2 dataElements (ids) to report elements (labels and figures)**. 
	* Same sheet as above, but look at the specific tabs: “[Mapping for Rapport de la Zone](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XW3JFWwOEP2GzAKgLOjCCQOt0vGXPgzbKxxiIOY8K8w/edit?usp=sharing)”, “Mapping for … ”, …
	* Also refer to the documents with the naming of each “visuals” for correct reference and mapping:
		* [[Rapport de la Zone - Plots to reproduce]]
		* [[Rapport de l'Antenne - Plots to reproduce]]
		* [[Rapport de bord National - Plots to reproduce]]
