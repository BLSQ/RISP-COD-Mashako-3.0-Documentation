The original product that we are working to replace is a Tableau dashboard produced and maintained by Acasus.
This has only one interactive thing: the choice of the org unit (ZS for Rapport de la Zone, Antenna for Repport de l’Antenne, no choice for Rappport de bord National) and the period (year and month) and therefore dashoard effectively works as a report …
However, the user was able to vision the content (which could take several minutes to load) online (in the browser). Then, if they wanted, they could download the report as PDF, which was simply a (paginated, one tab per page) print screen of the Tableau dashoard. The generation of this report also could take several minutes (once I timed it and it took XX minutes to generate the XXX).

Notes:
* To mimic such experience, it could be interesting to provide the option to visualize the report as HTML file in the browser - instead of having to download the PDF and open it locally.
